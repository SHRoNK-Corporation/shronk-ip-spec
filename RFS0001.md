## 1. INTRODUCTION

SHRoNK-IP is an open specification designed for IP readback and lookup services. It outlines a standardized set of endpoints and responses, enabling the easy development of API clients. This standard is developed by SHRoNK Corporation in collaboration with the community.  
  
The [reference server](https://github.com/SHRoNK-Corporation/shronk-ip) is written using the ASP.NET framework in C#. It serves as the de-facto standard implementation and should be used by most servers. Experimental alternate servers written in Rust and Python have been developed, however these are not yet recommended for regular use.

## 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR API CERTIFICATION

All SHRoNK-IP servers must be able to handle a high volume of requests without faltering under load.
This could mean sustaining several thousand requests
per second without issue. Ratelimiting of any kind is forbidden. Servers may not filter requests by IP, location or use CAPTCHA technology.

SHRoNK-IP does not support IPv6 in any form. Servers must not respond to IPv6 requests.

All SHRoNK-IP servers must return data in the same JSON format and provide the same feature-set.
A [SHRoNK-IP Certified Certification™](https://shronk.net/ipverify) tool has been developed,
allowing developers and administrators to test that their SHRoNK-IP servers are up to spec.

## 3. SPECIFICATION
Endpoints:
| URI | Mandatory | Description |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
| / | yes | The core functionality, details of the connecting IP |
| /full | yes (can redirect to /) | Addditional details of the connecting IP |
| /lookup | yes | Details of a specified IP |
| /imfeelinglucky | yes | Details of a slightly modified IP |
| /raw | yes | The connecting IP, returned in plaintext |
| /info | yes | The server being used and its operational details |

### 3.0 FORMAT

All successful responses MUST return a JSON document. The keys required vary by each endpoint. Servers SHOULD attempt to return as many of the specified keys as possible, but MUST return all required keys.

Additionally, in order to comply with legal regulations, you SHOULD include `source` and `legalease` where applicable, and optionally
any additional data to comply with your data source's license.

An example response body follows:

```json
{
  "ip": "203.0.113.63",
  "city": "Example",
  "asn": 1234,
  "isp": "SHRoNK Media",
  "legalese": "Example",
  "source": "Example"
}
```

A significantly less optimal however still valid response body:

```json
{
    "ip": "203.0.113.63",
}
```

Accepted keys are as follows. Servers SHOULD not return any other keys, or change the name or contents of said keys. Any key not listed here is invalid and MUST be ignored by compliant clients.]
The example response class used by the reference server can be found [here](https://github.com/SHRoNK-Corporation/shronk-ip/blob/main/IPResult.cs).

### 3.1 / (root)

The root URI path MUST perform a lookup of the current request's remote IP address. A lookup MUST be fresh, and should not be served from a cache.
A root-level lookup SHOULD include some of the keys listed below, but not as many as that of the /full endpoint.  
Servers MUST never return null responses. If data is not available, the key must not be provided.

| Key | Value Type | Optional | Description |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `ip`  | string     | no       | The IP address of the request/lookup |
| `city` | string    | yes      | The city the IP is located in |
| `country` | string | yes      | The country the IP is located in |
| `countryCode` | string | yes  | The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code |
| `brexitRequired` | bool | yes  | Whether the IP's country is NOT in the European Union |
| `asn` | long    | yes      | The ASN of the IP |
| `isp` | string     | yes      | The ISP of the IP |
| `lat` | double      | yes, unless `lon` is provided      | The latitude of the IP |
| `lon` | double      | yes, unless `lat` is provided      | The longitude of the IP |
| `hostname` | string | yes     | The hostname of the IP (usually rDNS) |
| `timezone` | string | yes     | The timezone of the IP, matching that of the IANA time zone database |
| `locale` | string   | yes      | The locale of the IP, as estimated based on the country |
| `subnet` | string   | yes      | The subnet of the IP, expressed in CIDR notation |
| `isMetric` | bool | yes  | Whether the IP's country uses the metric system |
| `currency` | string   | yes      | The currency of the IP's country |
| `legalese` | string | yes     | The license of the data source |
| `source` | string   | yes     | The data source |

<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip": "203.0.113.63", "city": "Example", "asn": 1234, "lat" -1.0, "lon": -1.1, "timezone": "Etc/Utc"}
```

</detail>

### 3.2 /full

The /full URI endpoint SHOULD return a similar response to the root endpoint, but with more detail. It SHOULD provide all keys listed above.  

The SHRoNK-IP Certified Certification™ will score your server based on how many of the keys on this endpoint are correctly provided.  

If not implemented, the /full endpoint MUST redirect to the root URI.  

<detail>
<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET /full HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip":"203.0.113.63","city":"Example","country":"Principality of Sealand","countryCode":"SL","brexitRequired":false,"lat":1.0,"lon":0.1,"asn":1234,"isp":"SHRoNK Media","subnet":"203.0.113.0/24","hostname":"example.com","timezone":"Etc/Utc","locale":"en-SL","isMetric":true,"currency":"SHRoNKingtonian Tear of the Less Fortunate","legalese":"Example","source":"Example"}
```

</detail>


### 3.3 /lookup

The /lookup URI endpoint MUST perform a lookup of the given IP address, NOT the request's remote IP (unless explicitly requested).

/lookup MUST take at least one query string parameter, `ip`, which is the IP address to perform a lookup for. `ip` is REQUIRED, and CANNOT
have a default value.

Servers SHOULD perform validation to ensure the provided IP is at least a valid IPv4 address, however it is not requred.

/lookup MUST return the same information as 3.1, including any optional fields previously used.

<detail>
<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET /lookup?ip=203.0.113.72 HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip": "203.0.113.62", "city": "Example", "asn": 1234, "lat" -1.0, "lon": -1.1, "timezone": "Etc/Utc"}
```

</detail>

### 3.4 /imfeelinglucky

The /imfeelinglucky endpoint SHOULD marginally adjust an IP octet from the request's remote IP address, based upon a random value.
This value MUST either increase or decrease a random octet the request's remote IP by one, based on this random value.
Alternatively, the IP can be left untouched.

For example, if a random number is picked between 1 and 1000, and is greater than 700, you can increase the second octet of the IP.
If the value is less than 700 but greater than 500, you can decrease the fourth octet.
If the value is none of the above, the IP is returned untouched.

The endpoint MUST return the same data as in 3.1, however with a modified IP value.
The returned IP address SHOULD be validated to ensure it is valid, however this is not required.

<detail>
<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET /imfeelinglucky HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip": "203.0.113.63", "city": "Example", "asn": 1234, "lat" -1.0, "lon": -1.1, "timezone": "Etc/Utc"}


GET /imfeelinglucky HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 105
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip": "203.0.113.255", "city": "Example", "asn": 1234, "lat" -1.0, "lon": -1.1, "timezone": "Etc/Utc"}
```

(in this example, `203.0.113.63` is the request IP, however in the second request the 4th octet has been randomised)

</detail>

### 3.5 /raw

The /raw endpoint MUST simply return the request's remote IP address as a plain-text unmodified string.

```plain
GET /raw HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 14
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

203.0.113.62
```

### 3.6 /info

The /info endpoint MUST return details of the SHRoNK-IP server, its maintainer, and its current certification status as determined by the SHRoNK-IP Certified Certification™ tool - in the form of a Pass ID.

<detail>
<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET /info HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"server":"SHRoNK-IP Reference Server v2.0.0","maintainer":"SHRoNK Corporation","passID":5627539451}
```

</detail>  

## 4. Certification and Verification

As mentioned above, the SHRoNK-IP Certified Certification™ tool allows operators to test their API implementation meets the specification.  
It also provides a way for end users to verify that the certifications issued by the tool. For every certification, a Pass ID is issued. This ID is 10 digits long. It starts with `5` for SHRoNK-IP Plus certified servers, and `1` for all other servers.  
Non-passing servers are not issued a Pass ID. Users can obtain a server's Pass ID from the /info endpoint.  

This ID can be verified using the `/check/api/verify` endpoint. The passID should provided in a similar manner to IP addresses with the /lookup endpoint. An example request is below:

<detail>
<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET /check/api/verify?passID=5456924545 HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

```

## 5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Due to the popularity of SHRoNK-IP servers, they must be able and should expect to handle extreme loads in excess of 1000 requests per second.
Server administrators may wish to employ load-balancing techniques, such as using multi-threaded or asynchronous web servers, time-based caching, several workers, and
clusters. However, as long as the server responds in a timely manner, with the correct data, any load balancing techniques are not defined as mandatory or restricted.

### 5.1 CORS

Server administrators SHOULD allow CORS from all origins on their servers. This is not a requirement, however it is recommended.  
This would allow web-based services to access your SHRoNK-IP instance without needing to use an additional server as a proxy.  
The SHRoNK-IP Certified Certification™ tool tests for proper CORS support.  

Operators SHOULD ensure their web server responds with the following CORS headers:  
```plain
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET OPTIONS HEAD
```
