## 1. INTRODUCTION

SHRONK IP is a set of utilities accessible over the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
These utilities include IP echo-back and IP Geolocation services.

## 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION

All SHRONK IP servers must be able to handle a high volume of requests without faltering under load.
This could mean sustaining several thousand requests
per second without erroring out. Ratelimiting is forbidden.

All SHRONK IP servers must also return data in the same JSON format, and take the same URL parameters, headers, and so on.
This allows them to then be tested with the certified SHRONK IP CERTIFICATION CERTIFIED tool,
which allows developers and administrators to test that their SHRONK IP servers are up to spec.

## 3. SPECIFICATION

### 3.0 FORMAT

All successful responses MUST return a JSON document. The only REQUIRED key is `ip`, however additional data such as `city`, `country`,
`countryCode`, `asn`, and`isp` SHOULD be returned.

Additionally, in order to comply with legal regulations, you SHOULD include `source` and `legalease` where applicable, and optionally
any additional data to comply with your data source's license.

An example response body follows:

```json
{
    "ip": "203.0.113.63",
    "city": "Example",
    "country": "Exampleland",
    "countryCode": "EX",
    "asn": 9009,
    "isp": "ExampleNet"
}
```

A significantly less optimal however still valid response body:

```json
{
    "ip": "203.0.113.63",
}
```

Accepted keys are as follows. Any key not listed here is not valid and SHOULD be ignored by clients.

| Key | Value Type | Optional | Description |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `ip`  | string     | no       | The IP address of the request/lookup |
| `city` | string    | yes      | The city the IP is located in |
| `country` | string | yes      | The country the IP is located in |
| `countryCode` | string | yes  | The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code |
| `asn` | integer    | yes      | The ASN of the IP |
| `isp` | string     | yes      | The ISP of the IP |
| `legalese` | string | yes     | The license of the data source |
| `source` | string   | yes     | The data source |
| `lat` | float      | yes, unless `lon` is provided      | The latitude of the IP |
| `lon` | float      | yes, unless `lat` is provided      | The longitude of the IP |
| `hostname` | string | yes     | The hostname of the IP (usually rDNS) |
| `timezone` | [tz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) | yes     | The timezone of the IP |
| `locale` | string   | yes      | The locale of the IP |
| `subnet` | string   | yes      | The subnet of the IP |
| `abuse` | string    | yes      | The abuse contact of the IP (email or website) |

### 3.1 / (root)

The root URI path MUST perform a lookup of the current request's remote IP address. A lookup SHOULD be fresh, however CAN be served from a cache.
A root-level lookup SHOULD include all of the additional data in 3.0.

<detail>
<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip": "203.0.113.63", "city": "Example", "asn": 1234, "lat" -1.0, "lon": -1.1, "timezone": "Etc/Utc"}
```

</detail>

### 3.2 /lookup

The /lookup URI endpoint MUST perform a lookup of the given IP address, NOT the request's remote IP (unless explicitly requested).

/lookup MUST take at least one query string parameter, `ip`, which is the IP address to perform a lookup for. `ip` is REQUIRED, and CANNOT
have a default value.

Servers SHOULD perform validation to ensure the provided IP is at least a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address, however it is not requred.

/lookup MUST return the same information as 3.1, however it MAY not include as much optional data.

<detail>
<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET /lookup?ip=203.0.113.72 HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip": "203.0.113.62", "city": "Example", "asn": 1234, "lat" -1.0, "lon": -1.1, "timezone": "Etc/Utc"}
```

</detail>

### 3.3 /imfeelinglucky

The /imfeelinglucky endpoint SHOULD marginally adjust an IP octet from the request's remote IP address, based upon a random value.
This value MUST either increase or decrease a random octet the request's remote IP by one, based on this random value.
Alternatively, the IP can be left untouched.

For example, if a random number is picked between 1 and 1000, and is greater than 700, you can increase the second octet of the IP.
If the value is less than 700 but greater than 500, you can decrease the fourth octet.
If the value is none of the above, the IP is returned untouched.

The endpoint MUST return the same data as in 3.1, however with a modified IP value.
The returned IP address SHOULD be validated to ensure it is valid, however this is not required.

<detail>
<summary>Example:</summary>

```plain
GET /imfeelinglucky HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 104
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip": "203.0.113.63", "city": "Example", "asn": 1234, "lat" -1.0, "lon": -1.1, "timezone": "Etc/Utc"}


GET /imfeelinglucky HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 105
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

{"ip": "203.0.113.255", "city": "Example", "asn": 1234, "lat" -1.0, "lon": -1.1, "timezone": "Etc/Utc"}
```

(in this example, `203.0.113.63` is the request IP, however in the second request the 4th octet has been randomised)

</detail>

### 3.4 /raw

The /raw endpoint MUST simply return the request's remote IP address as a plain-text unmodified string.

```plain
GET /raw HTTP/1.1
Host: shronk-ip.example
User-Agent: Example/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 14
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

203.0.113.62
```

### 4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Due to the popularity of SHRONK IP servers, they must be able and should expect to handle extreme loads in excess of 1000 requests per second.
Server administrators may wish to employ load-balancing techniques, such as using multi-threaded or asynchronous web servers, time-based caching, several workers, and
clusters. However, as long as the server responds in a timely manner, with the correct data, any load balancing techniques are not defined as mandatory or restricted.

#### 4.1 CORS

Some server administrators would greatly benefit from allowing CORS on their servers. This is not a requirement, however it is recommended.
This would allow web services to access SHRoNK IP servers without needing to use a server as a proxy.

All you need to do is make sure your web server responds with the following CORS headers:

```plain
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET OPTIONS HEAD
```

This will allow web applications to use your server!
